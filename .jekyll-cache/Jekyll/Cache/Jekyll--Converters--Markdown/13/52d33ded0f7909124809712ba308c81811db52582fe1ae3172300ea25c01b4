I"^<p>This project is an 8-channel projection-mapped video installation set to the track “Skip/Crush” from Canadian techno duo, Graze. Generative, audio-responsive graphics were programmed and mapped in Quartz Composer, Ableton Live, and Resolume Arena. The installation can be automated with a MIDI score and/or performed live with MIDI input.</p>
