I"²<p>16-page newspaper and set of 5 typographic posters resulting from a workshop with esteemed designer <a href="http://www.ludovic-balland.com/" target="_blank">Ludovic Balland.</a> Over  five days, five distinguished citizens of Valencia were interviewed about what news they read the day before, their reading habits, and the city in which they live. Each day, one team of students designed and produced a newspaper article for the dayâ€™s interview, while another team designed a typographic poster summarizing it. The final newspaper and poster series organize the content into a visual system as cultural commentary on how people remember information perceived in the daily media.</p>
